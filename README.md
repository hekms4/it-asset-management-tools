# 2025's Top 10 Best IT Asset Management Platforms

Whether you're equipping a hybrid workforce, managing global device fleets, or seeking to reduce IT operational costs by 40%, integrated ITAM solutions deliver visibility, automation, and control that manual processes simply cannot match.

## FAQ

**How quickly can we implement an IT asset management platform and see results?**

Modern ITAM platforms like Velory and InvGate Asset Management deploy in days or weeks rather than months—InvGate specifically claims 10x faster implementation than traditional solutions like ServiceNow. Cloud-based solutions require minimal infrastructure setup, with initial value appearing immediately through automatic device discovery and centralized visibility. Full workflow automation and integration with existing systems typically takes 2-6 weeks depending on complexity. Organizations using Workwize report 40%+ reduction in manual IT workload within the first month of deployment.

**What's the difference between IT asset management and device lifecycle management?**

IT Asset Management (ITAM) broadly covers tracking, managing, and optimizing all IT assets including hardware, software, licenses, and cloud resources throughout their lifecycles. Device Lifecycle Management (DLM) specifically focuses on physical hardware devices from procurement through disposal, emphasizing employee experience, onboarding/offboarding, and device retirement. Platforms like Velory and GroWrk specialize in DLM with strong employee-facing features, while tools like ServiceNow and Zluri provide comprehensive ITAM including software license management and compliance. Most modern platforms blur these lines by offering both capabilities.

**Can these platforms handle global device deployment across multiple countries?**

Yes, platforms like Workwize, GroWrk, and Velory specifically design for global operations managing devices across 150+ countries. They handle international procurement through global vendor networks, navigate country-specific regulations and compliance requirements, manage multi-currency transactions and leasing agreements, and coordinate logistics including customs and international shipping. Global capabilities differentiate enterprise-focused platforms from tools designed primarily for single-country operations. Verify specific country coverage with vendors as availability varies.
